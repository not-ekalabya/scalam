As one of the most geologically active regions on Earth, Southeast Asia is characterized by a complex mosaic of tectonic boundaries, ranging from subduction zones to transform faults. These geological processes have profound implications for the region's topography, climate patterns, and ecological diversity. Against this backdrop, understanding the intricate relationship between tectonic dynamics and biodiversity hotspots holds significant importance for conservation efforts and ecosystem management in this biologically rich and environmentally sensitive region."

For instance, mountain uplift creates isolated habitats, leading to speciation and unique flora and fauna. Volcanic eruptions can disrupt ecosystems but also enrich soils, fostering the establishment of new vegetation communities. Additionally, sea level changes alter coastal habitats, affecting marine biodiversity and coastal ecosystems. Studying these impacts provides insights into ecosystem responses to geological processes and informs management strategies amidst ongoing tectonic activity.",
